# detecting-iligal-u-turn-using-yolov8
We will use yolov8 to develop a machine learning technology that automatically detects illegal stopping vehicles that stop for more than 5 minutes and illegal U-turn vehicles that cross the solid yellow line. In case noise occurs in the cctv image, a large amount of learning materials were used and several yolo versions were used toimprovethespeed.
